This is exercise 1 in some computer vision course online of some university somewhere.
Here is the link to the exercise: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13CJgtDr8kIX9KIrs6BYFDF6-N7cfAyX0R54v8CWoqmQ/pub?embedded=true\ 

There are 3 modules: LineAlgorithms.py with general line algorithms for images, CircleAlgorithms.py with general circle algorithms for 

images and PS1_main.py which is the module executing the uses of the algorithms required in the exercise.

I hope whoever is reading this is happy with this readme and finds it satisfying happy holidays enjoy
